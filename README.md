## Main idea
A tag-centric social media centered around boards that automatically impart certain tags to the posts posted to them(they can be edited on a post by post basis but this makes it fast and easy to granularly catagorize posts). Two boards on the same topic(ie. with alot or even all of the same tags) can both have their own rules and modorators but posts from both can show up in searches and following timelines for the tag for example chess boards for beginners vs advanced players, when a user wants to see all chess posts easly they can search #chess but if they want to see only advanced conversation they can go to b/advancedChess.

Users follow tags; boards and users both have unique tags that appear on all their posts based on their unique name and connot be removed this is used to allow users to follow boards or users.

Posts can be geotaged and contain pictures or videos.
